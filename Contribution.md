### Contribute

#### Summary

It's easy to contribute to this project. The overall development cycle of this project is rather slow. I get to things when I get to them. Developing this program is a hobby and not a job which is why the cycle is so slow. Especially since I got the program to the late Beta stage and stable. Contributions are welcome and straight foward in the following order. So, send in contributions via email.
- zip up the python file containing your changes naming the file contrib_DateOfContribution.zip and attach to an email
- in the body of the email your name...
- a summary of your changes/additions - the summary will be included in the comments entered into the code where your changes appear
- the line numbers in the python file where your changes/additions appear
- send contribution to mdw1982@gmail.com with a subject line: MJournal Contribution

That's all there is to it. Once/if your changes are included they'll be included in the source code along with comments including your name and date of contribution.
