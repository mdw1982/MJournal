Welcome!
You've chosen to use this program, or at the very least to give it a try. I very much appreciate you giving the program a chance to see if it's a good fit for your journaling needs.

Creating this program has been both a necessity for me and a labor of love. I apolize in advance if there are any bugs or strange behavior. This program is in its mid beta stage, so there might be some weirdness here and there. If there is, please feel free to email me at mdw1982@gmail.com or post an issue on my  GitHub page for this program here: https://github.com/mdw1982/MJournal. Just click on issues and post away. Please provide as much detail as possible. it doesn't have to be technical... just what you were doing when the weirdness happened and what the result was. Feedback is much appreciated.

If, at any time you experience problems with the program please don't hesitate to let me know here: https://github.com/mdw1982/MJournal/issues. Please include as much detail as possible because it will help me diagnose and address the problem.

Enjoy!
